<!--
The polymorphism is a core concept of an object-oriented paradigm that provides a way to 
perform a single action in different forms. It provides an ability to call the same 
method on different JavaScript objects. As JavaScript is not a type-safe language, 
we can pass any type of data members with the methods.



1) overloading   not posiible 
2) overiding

<script>  
class A  
  {  
     display()  
    {  
      document.writeln("A is invoked<br>");  
    }  
  }  
class B extends A  
  {  
    display()  
    {  	
      document.writeln("B is invoked");  
    }

class C extends B

    display()  
    {  	
      document.writeln("C is invoked");

var a=[new A(), new B(), new C()]  
a.forEach(function(msg)  
{  
msg.display();
